A           Anton Heuschen        Ada TV stand welcome in our home At first I wanted to buy the smaller Ida stand but then decided the Ada is a bit larger and taller and better suited.  Although there is no holes in the open display shelves of this unit I easily drilled 3 holes, one for cables and 2 more for ventilation and it looks neat. Happy with the space of the top for TV and soundbar and 2 lamps to the side. It is a basic but neat unit, and fits in with a modern style and laminate flooring (but it will do fine in any room and flooring type)               E           Eugene Jooste         Ada TV Stand               T           Thabo Gumede        Excellent Service I love my Ada Tv stand and Manilo coffee table , my lounge is so beautiful.
