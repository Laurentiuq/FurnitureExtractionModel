Fabric Wardrobe, Foldable Closet with Hanging Rail, Clothes Rack, Storage Organiser for Bags, Toys, Shoes, Living Room, Bedroom, Cloakroom, 150 x 45 x 175 cm.
INVITE YOUR CLOTHES IN: Hang your clothes on the 2 rods of the fabric wardrobe in neat rows. Place your folded clothes on the shelves. When you need to pick your outfits for a big day, everything you have is just at your fingertips.
IT HAS THE STRENGTH: The hanging rail has a load capacity of 15 kg and the fabric layer holds 5 kg because its supported by 16 mm dia. metal tubes and quality non-woven fabric; the sturdiness and durability of the foldable closet are both assured.
AWAY FROM DUST: Your favorite new garment needs better protection. The fabric cover, equipped with a zipper and hook-and-loop fasteners, was handpicked to store your clothes properly. This clothes rack has you covered!
EASY TO ASSEMBLE: No more spending hours putting a fabric wardrobe together; the assembly here is all about attaching the tubes into the plastic connectors, no tools required. All thats left to do is display your shirts and dresses on the hanging rail.
