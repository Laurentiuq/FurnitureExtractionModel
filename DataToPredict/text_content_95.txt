Description 
This Item is Final Sale.
Chic AND comfortable! This is Wazos take on a classic mid-century modern sofa. Using our patented foam technology, youll feel like youre sitting on a cloud. Yes, we are primarily known for the excellent craftsmanship of our solid wood furniture, but we took that same obsessive approach to high quality and applied it to our sofas. We traveled to dozens of factories and sat on hundreds of sofas to deliver a collection that we are truly proud and excited about. We did not cut corners in terms of quality or material, because we want you to stay excited about your Wazo sofa for years to come.
