Why  Amazonas?
Over 30 years ago our founder Matthias traveled through South America in a canoe, sleeping in a hammock he made with the help of the Huaorani Indian tribe. It transformed his experience and gave him the rest he needed to travel through the dense rainforest, and avoid being bitten by the many critters that roamed the forest floors.Returning to Germany he began to sell hammocks to his friends and family. Eventually, demand grew and now Amazonas is recognised as one of the best manufacturers of hammocks in the world with factories in South America and around Europe.All our hammocks are now made by skilled experts using only the best materials, which is why we are the only hammock manufacturer to carry the GS Quality and TUV Safety marks, which recognise the exceptional safety and quality of what we do.

HAPPY CUSTOMERS
We have had great customer service from start to finish, very personable. I've been setting the hammocks up and it's super-easy and it feels like your building a ship which is an added bonus. Great, great, bloomin great.Oliver S
Cracking hammock I bought for the wifes 60th. She seems to fall asleep effortlessly in it. First class after-sales service, so refreshing. I can't speak highly enough of this company and would recommend the hammock without reservation. Jon M
The products are really well made and very sturdy. It was easy to put together and the hammock is so comfortable. Delivery was lightening fast and I am going to order a travel one to take away with me on my holidays. Peter Ja
My first hammock and I am not sure how i have survived without one. It is the best feature in my garden and has already given me hours of relaxation.Jenny Patersons
