Hidden inside this cube ottoman is something very clever. Because the S-Cube easily transforms into 5 stools! The new design is even more compact and comfy.
Firstly, use the ottoman as a footrest or chair for your small space desk or even coffee/dining table. Secondly, when it's time for a get-together, remove the lid and slide out four additional stools. Subsequently, remove the sides of the cube ottoman and attach them easily to the stool tops - voila!  Seating is cushioned, with a PU material, so it's easy to clean. Available in black or grey, so pick the colour that suits your decor. 
KEY FEATURES+ New design+ Versatile seating (so it can be used from desk to dining)+ Beautiful ottoman with PU cushioned seating when assembled+ Ideal for home office, kitchen, kid's room, dining room, living room+ Cube ottoman
Dimensions: 19.5"W x 19.5"D x 21.5"H
