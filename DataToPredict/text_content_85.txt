Aham Bhumika
Aham Bhumika is an NGO (Non-Government Organisation) based in Bhopal, a city in the state of Madhya Pradesh in India. It has been set up by a diverse group of artists, housewives, engineers, tourist guides, teachers and government employees, who work for the betterment of the underprivileged in rural areas of India. 
The charity mainly works in two villages on the outskirts of Bhopal, with an aim to enable rural women to earn a livelihood and be self-sufficient. As part of Aham Bhumikas embroidery project, more than 30 skilled rural women artisans, have thus far been trained and employed to create some truly unique and beautiful products including sarees, tote bags and cushion covers.
