Rileys is now West Avenue Furniture
same family, new style
Rileys Goes West
Rileys Real Wood Furniture is growing, and we want you to know that our commitment to quality craftsmanship, top-grade materials, and customer care remains the focus of our business.
Now, in its 46th year, President Josh West (son of Riley and Lisa West) is expanding the business and taking it national with new furniture offerings, a redesigned online shopping experience, white glove delivery nationwide, and a new name. A name that represents the entire West family and the family furniture stores origins.
Welcome to West Avenue Furniture.
Conscious | Captivating | Confident
When we began rebranding, we knew we wanted to pay homage to Rileys Real Wood Furniture, our company name for the past 24 years. So, believe us when we say deciding on a new name was quite the undertaking. We knew we wanted to honor our family business while infusing it with contemporary style and modernity. After months of brainstorming, we fell in love with West Avenue Furniture. West is our family name, and our first showroom opened on West 11th Avenue in Eugenean actual moment of serendipity.
West Avenue Furnitures mission is to inspire creativity and curiosity in our clients furniture selection. To step outside the unoriginal and be genuinely captivated by the Northwest Modern Furniture Lifestyle.
