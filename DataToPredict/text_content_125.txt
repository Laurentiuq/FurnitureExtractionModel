The word Tir is the Celtic/Cornish word for Land. As the pendants name descends from Cornwall, so do their form. Valley spanning viaducts, china clay waste piles, known locally as the cornish alps, and mining engine houses are three unmistakably cornish landmarks, and ones that have inspired our first set of elegant wooden pendant lights.
From left to right the Viaduct, Cornish Alp, and Engine house make up our debut lighting collection, and work fantastically as a set, or individually. Hung inline, or bunched in small sets the pendants are perfectly suited in contemporary and traditional interiors as well as hung low along dining tables and kitchen islands, bar tops, and as atmospheric commercial lighting.
Turned from laminated blocks of solid hardwoods, the Tir pendants are elegantly intelligible representations of their inspired forms, and are beautiful in their simplicity, and quality of craft.
Avaliable in Ash, Oak, Walnut, Ebonized Ash, and Cork the lamps work individually, or bunched. Each light is hand turned, and finished with several coats of clear hard wax oil. 
The light comes with all fittings; 1.5m of black braided fabric cable, and matching timber ceiling rose. The lamps hold their own weight through the cable, and must be used with a low wattage E14 LED bulb.
