description 
The Chieut table, a contemporary low table, has been described as the quintessential minimalist design project. Originally conceived by Swedish based South Korean designer Jay Design in 2012, this beautiful ethereal piece seems to defy the law of gravity. The Chieut has attracted the praise of leading architectural luminaries such as the Zaha Hadid Architects and was the recipient of the prestigious Golden A' Design Award in 2017.
The Chieut table is entirely handcrafted in Italy by design atelier Minimaproject with the finest materials in a limited edition of 200 pieces to guarantee the uniqueness of each piece. Both body and legs can be ordered in a number of powder coating colour finishes to obtain interesting cromatic combinations. Small imperfections might be present-evidence that our pieces are unique and not mass produced.
Dimensions: 100 x 56,5 x h40,5 cm
