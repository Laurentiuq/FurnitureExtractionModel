Why is it Special?
Sometimes we feel like we dont have enough time or space for ourselves. We work hard on projects, take good care of our relationships, and spend so much energy daily that by the end of each day we are often too tired to do what we want. What we have to do takes precedence over who we want to be. This is where the Self Planner comes in. We made this specifically for us and you.The Self Planner holds space for you to elevate your day-to-day by encouraging you to prioritize the things that matter to you every day with inspirational quotes,  room for journaling, and different questions for introspection. Whether that means finally trying that new activity, reconnecting with an old friend, or simply stepping away from your desk, you create room for yourself.
