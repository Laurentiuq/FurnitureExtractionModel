This item is part of our Considered CollectionElegantly sculptural, the Molloy collection of dining tables, chairs, shelving and coffee tables feature fluid detailing inspired by a rare act of nature.The idea for the artfully rounded joinery, where two elements meet and seamlessly become one, comes from the unusual meeting of two rivers to form the Molloy River in Western Australia  a place where Adam Goodrum hand-built a holiday home with his family. The Molloy collection is available in a variety of timber finishes.Winner of the Good Design Awards 2016.

By Adam Goodrum
A firm believer that every environment is defined by the objects within it, Adam Goodrum designs with the philosophy that an object must therefore justify its existence  through its story and detailing. For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftsmanship, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality. In recent years, Goodrums work has been awarded a host of design accolades including the NGV Rigg Prize, Vogue x Alessi Design Prize, Indesign Luminary Award and the Idea Awards Editors Medal. He has also been commissioned to design pieces for several global luxury brands including Veuve Clicquot, Alessi and Cappellini.
